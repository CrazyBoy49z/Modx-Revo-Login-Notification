It provides an email notification on manager login. 
This is a security feature so an administrator can quickly detect a fraudulent connection.

Features:

 * Dead simple. Really.
 * Works out of the box with sensible default
 * Detects successful connection to the manager
 * Specify which address to send the notification to (and also CC/BCC).
 * Conveniently provides useful placeholders (IP, useragent, ...) to use in your email body
